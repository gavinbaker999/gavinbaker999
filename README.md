### Welcome to End House Software

A portfolio of websites I have designed including a dotNET window forms application to edit data files used for the Aladdin's website can be found at [http://endhousesoftware.byethost11.com/website/promosheets/promosheet.htm](http://endhousesoftware.byethost11.com/website/promosheets/promosheet.htm).

My Perl scripts include UNIX utilities grep and tail look-alikes, a static code analyser – ‘Code Browser’, a prototype of my graphical chat system and some data translation scripts in Perl(Tk). I am now re-engineering ‘Code Browser’ to benefit from Perl’s OO paradigm. I choose to use PHP as the target language to compile VHDL and Verilog source code into for the ‘HDL Work Bench’, which along with a simulation control script also written in PHP can be run on almost any web host or locally via Apache to produce a data file of the electronic system’s operation which can then plotted as a graph of signals versus time.I did a bit of .NET/C# in about 2012 to develop a windows forms application to update the data files for a website. I have now returned to .Net/C# and are using the Blazor framework to develop amongst others a GraphQL client – ‘EHS Control Panel’ - which communicates with my NodeJS GraphQL API server.

In the last 10 years or so, I have also been using NodeJS along with some standard modules like express, passport, etc. Using this combination my projects have included a GraphQL API server and a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – that includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blobs data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules.

I have also used Java to develop an application framework, with which my ‘HDL Work Bench’ and ‘UML Work Bench’ projects have been developed.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for  parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role. Over the last few years, with the increasing complexity of software deployment, I have also been involved in  the role of DevOps to cover both the software development and the tool chains need to deploy the software including use Github for source control and CI/CD pipelines.
