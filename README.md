### Welcome to End House Software

A portfolio of my work can be found at [http://www.endhousesoftware.com/promosheets/promosheet.htm](http://www.endhousesoftware.com/promosheets/promosheet.htm), project blog at [https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm](https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm) and Github Repository at [https://github.com/gavinbaker999](https://github.com/gavinbaker999).
 
A Raspbery PI 5 runs as a media server (Jellyfin), print server (CUPS), MQTT message broker, NAS backup server (Samba) and a software development system. One of the software projects is a object detection system using the OpenCV, Tensor Flow and Panda libraries. My home network, also has Raspberry PI Zeros that run the Weather Station and robotic projects and serval Raspberry Pi Picos used in various data collection projects. A Pi400 is used as a retro gaming console running the Retro Game OS.

Use of .NET (C#) to develop applications including updating website config files, EHS Admin Control Panel which communicates with my NodeJS GraphQL API and SignalR servers to give me system wide status information, EHS Status Moblie App (MAUI/Android) and a web bot to provide a FAQ and help system for my applications. I use Microsoft Azure for app services, storage blobs, queues, tables, function apps, logic apps, Cosmos DB, SQL DB, web bots, cognitive services (LUIS, QnAMaker and language translation), SignalR and application insights for my applications.

I have also been using NodeJS (using the express framework) to develop projects including a GraphQL API server and a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – at [https://ehschatter-box.herokuapp.com/](https://ehschatterbox.herokuapp.com/) that includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blobs data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules.

Over the last few years, to deal with the increasing complexity of software deployment, I have developed a ‘Job Control System’ that runs on Microsoft Access. Also been involved in the role of DevOps to cover the tool chains need to build and deploy my software (including use of Github for source control and Github Actions for CI/CD pipelines) and backup\hardware\software recovery plans and the use of Perl to code data translation and website scripts.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good time keeping, communication and organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role.
