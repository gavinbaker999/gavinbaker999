### Welcome to End House Software

A portfolio of my work can be found at [http://www.endhousesoftware.com/projects/projects.htm](http://www.endhousesoftware.com/projects/projects.htm), project blog at [https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm](https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm) and Github Repository at [https://github.com/gavinbaker999](https://github.com/gavinbaker999).
 
My home lab network consists of two Raspberry PI 5 servers. One Raspberry PI 5 server has an attached 2TB USB drive that has various shares that can be accessed via Samba and contains a software development system for my NodeJs applications - primarily Chatter Box and the dymanic PHP part of my website - Ansible playbooks (to update configurations across groups of servers with one command) - the ARR application stack (Prowlarr, Sonarr, etc.), DosBox, Docker swarm manager and the OpenShot video processing software. The other - with an attached camera module - includes as well as other bits, the media server (Jellyfin), testbed for my TensorFlow/CV2 image regcogntion projects, KiCad and Arduino. Both Pi 5 servers run common software, which includes amoung others, SyncThing, Portainer, Pi Cockpit, NetData, Obsidian, Git, Docker, VS Code and Libre Office. 

My home lab also has a ZimaBoard 2 kick starter server to which a 2TB SATA III drive is attached and a PCIe 3 WiFi adaptor card. The ZimaBoard 2 is a single board computer with an Intel Celeron N5105 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage. It has two USB 3.0 ports, a newly upgraded PCIe 3.0 interface and the dual 2.5G Ethernet ports unlock greater hardware expansion possibilities and ultra-fast data transfer experiences. The new MiniDP 1.4 interface delivers vibrant 4K visuals for your movies, while the classic dual SATA interfaces allow ZimaBoard 2 to easily expand storage capacity. The ZimaBoard 2 is a great addition to my home lab cluster as it will allow me to run more demanding applications and services, in my case mainly as a Mini NAS, VM Manager, Crafty Mincraft server, Immich server and local AI processing. 

The home lab network, also contains a Raspberry Pi 4 with the Sense HAT, which I am using as a test node for new hardware and software, another Raspberry Pi4 on which I intend to install Android version 16 to test my moblie software applications, an ESP32 breakout development box, a Raspberry PI Zero/ESP32s that run the Weather Station. A Pi400 is used as a retro gaming console running the Retro Game OS and I also have a Xbox kicking around somewhere. 

I have installed a 'Home Assistant Green' as my smart home hub. This includes, amongst other things, the main home dashboard, the Visual Studio add on so I can edit configuration files, Google calender add on, SSH Terminal add on, Uptime Kuma and Glances add ons for network monitoring, Music Assistant add-on, ESP32 Home add-on, Mosquitto broker add-on which processes MQTT messages from the Weather Station and other IoT devices and the Frigate add-on for anaylsing the images from my security cameras. The InfuxDB database collects time series data from Home Assistant. The Grafana application connects to the InfluxDB database allowing us to define nice looking dashboards. Grafana is also able to connect to other data sources. These two applications run on my Zima Board 2 srrver. An old Android tablet has been repurposed as a wall tablet using the Fully Koisk' application. I am also developing ESP32 addon modules that use the ESP Home HA intergration including using BLE beacons in each room so that HA can use my room location in automations.

An active intrest in IoT and electronics, has lead to building projects in the areas of smart homes, weather station, robotics and data collection mostly using the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi families with Python, Rust and Go. I am now tending to favour the ESP32 micro-controller and the ESP Home integration in Home Assistant over the Raspberry Pico family. I have also started a project of transferring my home lab cluster into a mini-rack and attempting a little bit of cable management. 

I also use Windows and .NET (C#) to develop applications including updating website config files, SignalR Hub, EHS Admin Control Panel (Blazor) which gives me system wide status information, Stripe for credit card processing, SendGrid for sending emails, EHS Android Test App (MAUI/Android) to provide a test rig to expirment with Android programming and an Azure Web Bot - GavBot the Third - to provide a FAQ and help system for my applications. I use Microsoft Azure for app services, storage blobs, queues, tables, function apps, logic apps, Cosmos DB, SQL DB, web bots, cognitive services (LUIS, QnAMaker and language translation), SignalR and application insights for my applications.  also involved in software projects for an object detection system using the OpenCV, Tensor Flow and Panda libraries. 

I have also been using NodeJS (using the express framework) to develop a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – at [https://ehschatter-box.herokuapp.com/](https://ehschatterbox.herokuapp.com/) that uses the HTML5 canvas control and includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blob data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules and a test NuGet module.

I use the Obsidian application for all my note taking and Todoist to keep track of all my ToDo lists. Over the last few years, to deal with the increasing complexity of software development and deployment, I have developed a ‘Job Control System’ that runs on Microsoft Access and also use Github for source control and Github Actions for CI/CD pipelines. I also have devloped a project management system writtem in PHP. I also write a hardware/software blog that is updated with what I have learnt in my travels. I have also done projects, using kickstarter products like the Sandwizz Bread Board and the Fipsy FPGA, see my project blog at [https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm](https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm) for more details.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good time keeping, communication and organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role.
