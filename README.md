### Welcome to End House Software

A portfolio of my work can be found at [http://www.endhousesoftware.com/projects/projects.htm](http://www.endhousesoftware.com/projects/projects.htm), project blog at [https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm](https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm) and Github Repository at [https://github.com/gavinbaker999](https://github.com/gavinbaker999).
 
My home lab network consists of a Raspberry PI 5 running as my main Linux box, which includes media server (Jellyfin), print server (CUPS), MQTT message broker, NAS backup server (Samba), RealVNC, Libre Office, KiCad and a software development system. The home lab network, also contains ESP32 breakout development box, Raspberry PI Zeros that run the Weather Station and robotic projects and serval Raspberry Pi Picos used in various data collection projects. A Pi400 is used as a retro gaming console running the Retro Game OS.

I also use Windows and .NET (C#) to develop applications including updating website config files, EHS Admin Control Panel (Blazor) which communicates with my NodeJS GraphQL API and SignalR servers to give me system wide status information, EHS Android Test App (MAUI/Android) to provide a test rig to expirment with Android programming and an Azure Web Bot - GavBot the Third - to provide a FAQ and help system for my applications. I use Microsoft Azure for app services, storage blobs, queues, tables, function apps, logic apps, Cosmos DB, SQL DB, web bots, cognitive services (LUIS, QnAMaker and language translation), SignalR and application insights for my applications.  also involved in software projects for an object detection system using the OpenCV, Tensor Flow and Panda libraries. An active intrest in electronics, has lead to building projects in the areas of smart homes, weather station, robotics and data collection mostly using the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi families with Python.

I have also been using NodeJS (using the express framework) to develop projects including a GraphQL API server and a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – at [https://ehschatter-box.herokuapp.com/](https://ehschatterbox.herokuapp.com/) that uses the HTML5 canvas control and includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blob data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules and a test NuGet module.

Over the last few years, to deal with the increasing complexity of software development and deployment, I have developed a ‘Job Control System’ that runs on Microsoft Access and also use Github for source control and Github Actions for CI/CD pipelines. I also write a hardware/software blog that is updated with what I have learnt in my travels.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good time keeping, communication and organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role.
