I have also been using NodeJS (using the express framework) to develop projects including a GraphQL API server and a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – that includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blobs data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules. Also experience of REST APIs.

NodeJS Modules [https://npmjs.com/~gavinbaker](https://npmjs.com/~gavinbaker) - A general support module and a message queue processing module.

Python development to support my use of a Raspbery PI 400 which runs as a media, backup and SSH shell server on my home network. I am also using Raspbery PI Zero and Pico models to develop automation, robotic and data collection projects. These include a robot that can sense its enviroment and a weather station.

I have been using .NET/C# (Windows Forms/MVC/Blazor SDK) to develop applications including an application to update the data files for a website, EHS Control Panel which communicates with my NodeJS GraphQL API and SignalR servers to give me system wide status information and a web bot to provide a FAQ and help system for my applications. I use Microsoft Azure for storage blobs, queues, tables, function apps, logic apps, Cosmos DB, SQL DB, web bots, cognitive services (LUIS, QnAMaker and language translation), SignalR and application insights for my applications.

Also the ability to use custom GraphQL queries (aka EHS API) to obtain system status information.

Job Control System - A Microsoft Access database based job control system allowing me to track my project's tasks, costs, meetings, releases, etc.

My Perl scripts include a static JAVA source code analyser – ‘Code Browser’, a prototype of my graphical chat system (Perl/Tk) and some data translation/system admin scripts. In parallel to the ‘UML Work Bench’, I am re-engineering ‘Code Browser’ to benefit from Perl’s OO paradigm, to run from the command line in for example a build tool chain.From my experience of using java applets on my web sites, I developed a Java application framework, with which my ‘HDL Work Bench’ and ‘UML Work Bench’ projects have been developed. I choose to use PHP as the target language to compile VHDL and Verilog source code into for the ‘HDL Work Bench’, which along with a simulation control module also written in PHP can be run on almost any web host or locally via Apache to produce a XML format data file of the electronic system’s operation which can then plotted as a graph of signals versus time.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for  parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role. Over the last few years, with the increasing complexity of software deployment, I have also been involved in  the role of DevOps to cover the tool chains need to build and deploy the software (including use Github for source control and Github Actions for CI/CD pipelines). Production of backup, hardware and software recovery plans.
