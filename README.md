### Welcome to End House Software

A portfolio of my work can be found at [http://www.endhousesoftware.com/promosheets/promosheet.htm](http://www.endhousesoftware.com/promosheets/promosheet.htm), project blog at [https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm](https://www.endhousesoftware.com/projectblog/projectblog.htm) and Github Repository at [https://github.com/gavinbaker999/Projects](https://github.com/gavinbaker999/Projects).
 
Using the Raspberry PI Zero and Pico models to develop automation, robotic and data collection projects. These include a robot that can sense its environment and a weather data collection station. Other services used include PushOver/Magic Bell for notifications. use of a Raspbery PI 400 which runs as a media, backup and SSH shell server on my home network.

Use of .NET/C# (Windows Forms/MVC/Blazor SDK) to develop applications including updating website config files, EHS Admin Control Panel which communicates with my NodeJS GraphQL API and SignalR servers to give me system wide status information and a web bot to provide a FAQ and help system for my applications. I use Microsoft Azure for storage blobs, queues, tables, function apps, logic apps, Cosmos DB, SQL DB, web bots, cognitive services (LUIS, QnAMaker and language translation), SignalR and application insights for my applications. Started to explore the use of .NET Maui to develop cross platform applications.

I have also been using NodeJS (using the express framework) to develop projects including a GraphQL API server and a graphical chat system – ‘Chatter Box’ – at [https://ehschatter-box.herokuapp.com/](https://ehschatterbox.herokuapp.com/) that includes features for automatic chat text language translation into 5 languages and interaction with MongoDB and Microsoft Azure storage blobs data stores. I also written a couple of NodeJS modules - hosted on NPM – a message queue store and general-purpose utility modules.

I have developed a Java application framework, with which my ‘HDL Work Bench’ and ‘UML Work Bench’ projects have been developed. I choose to use PHP as the target language to compile VHDL and Verilog source code into for the ‘HDL Work Bench’, which along with a simulation control module also written in PHP can be run on almost any web host or locally via Apache to produce an XML format data file of the electronic system’s operation which can then plotted as a graph of signals versus time. 

Over the last few years, to deal with the increasing complexity of software deployment, I have developed a ‘Job Control System’ based on Microsoft Access. Also been involved in the role of DevOps to cover the tool chains need to build and deploy my software (including use Github for source control and Github Actions for CI/CD pipelines) and backup\hardware\software recovery plans and the use of Perl to code data translation and website scripts.

I enjoy working in small teams and with good time keeping, communication and organization skills can work well under pressure to meet project deadlines. I can take the initiative and responsibility for parts of the project, enjoying learning new skills which can be latter shared with other team members maybe even taking on a mentoring role.
